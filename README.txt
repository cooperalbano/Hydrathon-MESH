						----------------------------------------------------
						
					  The workflow for this setup was obtained from the GitHub 
				repository available at: https://github.com/cooperalbano/MESH-Scripts
				
						----------------------------------------------------
						
					The basin discretization, climate forcing data, and land cover
				for the Saint Mary / Milk system were preprocessed by Kasra Keshavarz
					using EASYMORE (https://github.com/ShervanGharari/EASYMORE),
					   datatool (https://github.com/kasra-keshavarz/datatool),
					  and GISTool (https://github.com/kasra-keshavarz/gistool).
					 
								Basin discretization: 	MERIT-Hydro
								Climate forcing: 		RDRS v2.1
								Land cover:				MODIS
								
						----------------------------------------------------
						
					Several edits to the default workflow were necessary to complete
					   the setup using the pre-processed data. Important edits are 
											listed below:
										
					1. Add code to 'create_MESH_drainage_database.py to 
					   account for different values used to represent 
					   outlet stream segments in the 'tosegment' field.
									
							158| for i in range(0,len(tosegment)):
							159| 	if tosegment[i] == -9999:
							160|		tosegment[i] = 0
							
					   In the future, a cnotrol file setting could be added
					   to allow the user to specify this value, and avoid 
					   the need to modify the script for different data sources.
								
					2. Add the names of MODIS landcover types to the 
					   'create_MESH_drainage_database.py' script.
					   
					3. Fixed an incorrect suffix for the log file in 
					   'create_MESH_drainage_database.py'.
					   
					4. Due to a combination of file size and number of files,
					   the RDRS v2.1 forcing data for 2010 - 2018 could not
					   be merged all at once using 'forcing_merge.sh'. To fix
					   this, the script was modified to first merge into 9 
					   yearly files which were placed into '/root_path/forcing/years/'.
					   An additional line was added to then merge the yearly 
					   files into a single file for the entire period. See the
					   edited 'forcing_merge.sh' script at: 
					   
					   '/root_path/vector_based_workflow/4_climate_forcing/'
					   
					5. The default climate forcing variables for temperature, 
					   humidity, and wind speed were altered.
					   
					6. The script '4_MESH_vectorbased_forcing.py' was altered to
					   remove the control file input of the forcing name in favour
					   of manual entry. This was done because the script previously
					   assumed an output file name from the '2_easymore_remapping.py' 
					   script that was not used in the pre-processing for this setup.
					   
					7. The script '4_MESH_vectorbased_forcing.py' had assumed a 
					   dimension called 'ID' which was titled 'COMID' in the
					   pre-processed data used for this setup. The 'ID' dimension was
					   chamged to 'COMID'.
